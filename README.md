## Running the application 🍃

#### Info: I was not able to containerize the entire app, because there is an issue with Mac and Docker ports exposure. But there is a sever service inside the docker-compose that you can play with if you wish.


🔴 After cloning the project, you need to create a .env file, you can just rename the .env.example on the project and it should work just fine.

Now run the following command to start the project locally:

```bash
npm run deploy:locally
```
> This command installs all dependencies, builds the postgres image on Docker, runs prisma generate and migrations, to finally start the project locally.

#### You can check the Swagger documentation on the following URL: 📜

```bash
http://localhost:3000/api
```
#### If the applications is running smoothly, you should see the Swagger UI as the image below:

## Database Structure 🧮

The reason why chose this structure is because it keeps the data consistent and solid, even though there is redunduncy in it:

## To run the all tests simply execute: 

```bash
npm run api:tests
```

#### Known issue: If you get an error executing the app.spec.ts, you have to delete manually the postgres container, image and volume. For some reason sometimes the data is not cleaned.


# This section is to run the project step by step manually 📋
